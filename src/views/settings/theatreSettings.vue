<!-- This component aims to introduce a framework in which theatres can be set up and 
 missions can be planned outside of the established work flow - by defining a baseline theatre. 
 
 Things that should be configurable here are - Callsigns and squadrons, this will replace the 
 freely configurable callsigns from the flight page,
 
 configurations of comms entities, addition and modification of agencies like JTAC, AWACS, Tankers etc
 to be selectable on the flight/package configuration packages.-->
