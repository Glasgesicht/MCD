# MDC

Small project to genertate MDC's from Data import with many contextual presets for the use in the flight simulator "DCS: World"

This is in a heavy WIP state.
The current programm represets a rough scaffold of what this will eventually become.

Currently planned features include:

1. Full set of Kneeboard pages for export. [Done in collaboration with @iProphet]
2. Selective export to JPEG/ZIP for single pages, flights and packages. [60%]
3. Save and Load Presets, independently of CF Files. [Requires Backend work eventually]
4. Chooseable Airfields with their properties. [Just a matter of adding them]
5. DTC export [already working for the most part]
6. import .miz files, as well as DTC json and .cf files [currently only .cf is supported]
7. Many more features.
